# Hey there, I'm Mohet! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner on GitHub, where I explore, experiment, and build cool projects just for the fun of it.

## Who Am I?
Iâ€™m a passionate hobby developer who loves coding, tinkering, and diving into the latest web technologies. Whether Iâ€™m playing around with modern JavaScript frameworks, building nifty IoT gadgets, or contributing to openâ€‘source projects, Iâ€™m always up for a new challenge.

## What I Do
- **Frontend Fun:**  
  I love creating interactive and responsive web apps using **Vue.js**, **Nuxt.js**, and **React**. I enjoy experimenting with singleâ€‘page applications (SPA) and progressive web app (PWA) techniques.

- **Backend Adventures:**  
  When I'm not building slick interfaces, I'm writing lightweight APIs and scripts with **Node.js** and **Python**â€”just to keep things interesting.

- **IoT & Embedded Projects:**  
  I get a kick out of building smart, connected devices using **Arduino**, **Raspberry Pi**, and similar platforms. Itâ€™s all about mixing hardware with code to create something new!

- **Open-Source & Community:**  
  Iâ€™m a firm believer in the power of openâ€‘source. I contribute to projects, share my experiments, and love learning from the community.

## Current Interests
- Experimenting with **Nuxt3** and serverless deployments.
- Building fun, smallâ€‘scale **IoT** projects.
- Playing with modern CSS frameworks like **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI prototyping.

## Let's Connect!
Iâ€™m always excited to chat about code, tech, or just geek out over new ideas. Feel free to check out my projects, give them a star, fork something interesting, or just drop me a message if youâ€™d like to connect.

Happy coding!
