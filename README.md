Welcome to my little corner on GitHub, where I explore, experiment, and build cool projects just for the fun of it.

## Who Am I?
I’m a passionate hobby developer who loves coding, tinkering, and diving into the latest web technologies. Whether I’m playing around with modern JavaScript frameworks, building nifty IoT gadgets, or contributing to open‑source projects, I’m always up for a new challenge.

## What I Do
- **Frontend Fun:**  
  I love creating interactive and responsive web apps using **Vue.js**, **Nuxt.js**, and **React**. I enjoy experimenting with single‑page applications (SPA) and progressive web app (PWA) techniques.

- **Backend Adventures:**  
  When I'm not building slick interfaces, I'm writing lightweight APIs and scripts with **Node.js** and **Python**—just to keep things interesting.

- **IoT & Embedded Projects:**  
  I get a kick out of building smart, connected devices using **Arduino**, **Raspberry Pi**, and similar platforms. It’s all about mixing hardware with code to create something new!

- **Open-Source & Community:**  
  I’m a firm believer in the power of open‑source. I contribute to projects, share my experiments, and love learning from the community.

## Current Interests
- Experimenting with **Nuxt3** and serverless deployments.
- Building fun, small‑scale **IoT** projects.
- Playing with modern CSS frameworks like **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI prototyping.

## Let's Connect!
I’m always excited to chat about code, tech, or just geek out over new ideas. Feel free to check out my projects, give them a star, fork something interesting, or just drop me a message if you’d like to connect.

Happy coding!
